# CursorLootIcons
This download will swaps the cursor loot icons for the loot and loot all options.    
This is useful when using the [vanilla-tweaks](https://github.com/brndd/vanilla-tweaks) Quickloot reverse patch (hold shift to manual loot).

## Installation
Copy the "Interface" folder within the "CursorLootIcons-main" folder in the .zip to your WoW client folder.    
If you have installed this correctly, there should be a "Cursor" folder in the "Interface" folder (where the "AddOns" folder is located).

## Icons Swapped
The download swaps the following files:
- Pickup.blp > LootAll.blp
- UnablePickup.blp > UnableLootAll.blp
- LootAll.blp > Pickup.blp
- UnableLootAll.blp > UnablePickup.blp
